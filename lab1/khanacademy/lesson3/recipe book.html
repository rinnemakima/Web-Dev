                    </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 1) Place frozen dumplings (bought or made by hand) in a frying pan greased with vegetable oil and put on a slightly lower heat than the maximum (I put it on 5 out of 6). </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
Fry dumplings on both sides.
Cast iron gets a crust in no time, it holds and releases heat perfectly, so it does a great job with braising, stewing and other long-term tasks. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix water with salt and spices and pour it over the dumplings. (Attention! When pouring water immediately close the lid, it will splash a lot). </p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> As soon as all the water evaporates, remove from the heat. It is desirable to taste the broth for salt </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Serve with sour cream, mayonnaise, ketchup. </p>

                    <ul>
                    <li> Rice - 140g
                    <li> Nori - 1 sheet
                    <li> Cream cheese Cremetta (or Philadelphia) - 20 g
                    <li> Salmon - 30g
                    <li> Spice sauce - 15 g
                    <li> Tempura flour - 100 g
                    <li> Water - 50 ml
                    <li> Panko breadcrumbs - 50 g
                    <li> Umami sauce - 10 ml
                    <li> Vegetable oil - 1-1.5 litres (so that the roll is completely covered)
                    </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse the rice 2-3 times with running water. Fill a saucepan with 100 g of rice to 110 g of water. Put on maximum heat, cover with a lid. As soon as the water boils, reduce the heat to minimum and cook with the lid closed for 15 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat and leave for another 15 minutes with the lid closed. Prepare the sauce - mix 55g of 3 per cent vinegar, 45g of sugar and 5g of salt until dissolved. Pour 1 tbsp of the sauce into the rice.  </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Wrap the mat in cling film. Cook the rolls on the flat side of the mat. Grease the mat with vegetable oil to prevent it from sticking. Using hands soaked in water, stretch 140g of rice on half of the nori to make an even rectangle with no empty corners. Place a strip of cheese in the middle of the rice (it is convenient to use a pastry bag). Top with salmon slices cut into ~2×10 cm strips. Sprinkle with spice sauce (thick mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, flying fish roe). With a confident motion, roll up the roll so that the rice on one side of the fish and the other is interlocked. Pinch to make the roll tight. Wet the nori with water and roll the roll to the end. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix the tempura flour (or flour and salt) with the water to the consistency of pancake batter. Pour the breadcrumbs into a nearby container. Dip the roll first into the flour mixture, then into the breadcrumbs. Fry in high oil at 180 °C until orange crust is formed (30-40 seconds or even less). </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Slice the roll with a knife soaked in water. Sprinkle umami sauce on top. Eat! :-) </p>
